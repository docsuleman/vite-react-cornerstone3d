# UI Fixes Summary

## üêõ Issues Reported and Fixed

### Issue 1: Patient Selection Modal Transparency
**Problem**: Patient selection window was transparent and overlapping other text
**Solution**: 
- Changed background from `bg-black bg-opacity-50` to `bg-black bg-opacity-75`
- Added solid `bg-slate-900` background to modal content
- Added `border border-slate-700` for better definition

### Issue 2: Poor Contrast (Black and White Text)
**Problem**: All text was black and white with poor readability
**Solution**: 
- Replaced gray color scheme with slate colors for better contrast
- Updated text colors:
  - Primary text: `text-white` (high contrast)
  - Secondary text: `text-slate-300` (medium contrast)
  - Tertiary text: `text-slate-400` (low contrast but readable)
- Added blue accent colors for interactive elements

### Issue 3: No CT Images Visible After Patient Selection
**Problem**: No medical images were displayed after selecting a patient
**Solution**: 
- Created new `MPRViewport` component with VTK.js integration
